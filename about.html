          <p class="about_abstract">Automated cognitive assessment tools are state of the art in assessing human cognition development. Due to the low availability of the datasets and the complexity of collecting data to assess cognitive ability of primary grade sinhala children in Sri Lanka, this study focuses on developing machine learning models using a low quantity of data and develop models to assess Reasoning IQ, Knowledge IQ, Mental Chronometry and Attention-level evaluation. Our solution includes a speech recognition system to evaluate child’s verbal responses and vocabulary responses in Sinhala language, a Sinhala handwritten letter recognition model, hand drawn shape recognition model, gaze estimation, blink count detection and facial expression recognition model to evaluate the above four aspects of cognitive development of a child. For the speech recognition model, we have achieved a Word error rate (WER) of 40.1%and a validation accuracy of 97.14%.  For the Sinhala handwritten character recognition model, we have achieved a 97% validation accuracy. Also, we have achieved an 89% validation accuracy for the hand-drawn shape recognition model and an 85% accuracy for the combination of gaze estimation, blink count detection and facial expression recognition model</p>

                Intelligence is the metric that expresses variations in cognition across individuals [1] and refers to a person's ability to reason, solve problems, and learn. The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is used to measure an individual's intelligence derived from the results of specifically conducted tests. Initially, intelligence has been viewed as a fixed amount of cognitive capability that individuals are born with and cannot be increased [2]. However, later studies have found that different age groups have different IQ levels due to the cognitive development that begins during pregnancy and lasts until late adolescence [1]. 
                  IQ scores can help parents to establish realistic expectations based on their child's capabilities. The evidence, including a major meta-analysis of 65 studies, shows that IQ positively relates to educational and occupational achievements [3]. According to [4], Verbal Intelligence is a better predictor of academic success than other measurements. IQ scores also can be used to identify learning disabilities in children. 
                  More than a century of evidence has been amassed worldwide on cognitive ability assessments and the evaluation of correlates. This evidence has been used to advance society's progress, particularly population health. Additionally, it is generally acknowledged that these factors strongly depend on each individual's culture and environment [1]. Many intelligent scales and tools have been built to identify psychological conditions where some tests might specifically target a condition while others might be catered toward a general screening. 
                  The measuring Scale of Intelligence is the first validated cognitive measurement tool which was developed by psychologist Alfred Binet and psychiatrist Theodore Simon in 1905 at the request of the French government to identify students who would face the difficulties in schoolwork. The scale was composed of 30 rapid cognitive tests arranged in descending order of difficulty. The Binet-Simon Scale can be identified as the basis for modern IQ testing [5]. Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale is the standardized version of Binet's original test using a sample of American participants [6]. Another most prominent scale is the Wechsler intelligence scale which was published in 1939. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children can be used for children between the ages of 6 and 16 [7]. While the scales described below are not automated or digitalized, they are still used to measure cognitive abilities because of their credibility. 
                  Several automated tools are used globally to measure cognitive abilities. CogniFit General Cognitive Assessment tool measures general cognition in children above the age of 7 and adults. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is a language-independent, culturally neutral, non-invasive, and requires no technical knowledge or familiarity with computers, making them suitable for large, multi-site studies and diverse participant groups. The CANTAB batteries have been extensively used to assess cognitive performances in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Dementia, Korsakoff Syndrome, and Basal Ganglia disorders [7]

                Evidence on cognitive ability assessments and evaluation of its correlates have been accumulated over the past few years. They have been used in the advancements of the society, particularly in the health domain. Many intelligent scales and tools have been built to identify psychological conditions where some tests might specifically target a condition while others might be catered toward a general screening. The need for a systematically validated and automated cognitive assessment tool for children has been on the rise in the Sri Lankan Health Sector. Although globally prevalent and pioneers in intelligence scales such as Weschler and Stanford Binet exist, they have failed to address an important issue. The assessments are not culturally, linguistically or country-specific, even though attempts have been made to diversify tests to enable the localization of the functions of different processes in cognition. According to[1],  the International Classification of Diseases-10th revision identifies ten categories pertaining to specific disorders of psychological development. It states that it is mandatory to have a validated cognitive assessment to diagnose these deficiencies in children. Cognitive assessment tools such as Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and Stanford-Binet lack insight and evidence against the correlation of child cognitive capabilities in the Sri Lankan context. Moreover, these assessment tools have specific criteria to be met to gain authority for their usage, and significant commercial expenditure must be allocated for continuous usage. The growing number of child referrals into psychiatry units in Child hospitals in Sri Lanka has not helped the situation alone. This concludes that automated cognitive tools will be future-proof and add more value when evaluating cognitive abilities of children.

                Cognitive tests can reveal a child's degree of skill and what he or she is capable of. The research, which includes a large meta-analysis of 65 studies, suggests that cognition is linked to educational and vocational success. Learning difficulties can also be detected using cognitive assessment tests. To do so, you'll need to figure out if these kids are performing below expectations based on their standard. Those who do not meet the required standards may be suffering from one or more learning difficulties. Some of the most popular measures used by professionals while performing evaluations are the Wechsler series, the Woodcock-Johnson, and the Stanford-Binet. All of these empirically validated intelligence assessment measures are based on a range of variables used by test developers to evaluate intelligence, including verbal intelligence, visual and verbal memory, reasoning skills, processing speed, and other factors. 
                  All of the aforementioned measurements have been normed over a range of age groups, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses, and the test is chosen depending on the individual's specific qualities. And the approach for evaluating children's abilities must be one that all children are familiar with.Sri Lanka does not undertake a complete cognitive examination of children in the health sector using a fully automated cognitive assessment tool suited for the Sri Lankan context. The lack of a culturally relevant tool that can be utilized in the local languages is one reason for this. The second problem is the high commercial costs associated with globally recognized cognitive evaluation products. This has been increasingly difficult with the turn up of increasing patients into the

            Computer vision technologies are widely used in appearance-based gaze tracking techniques to detect the eye gaze. A video from a normal web camera or low-resolution camera is enough, but a large set of training data is required to make sure the accuracy of the estimation models are high. Basic machine learning models were used earlier but nowadays convolutional neural networks and deep neural networks are much more popular in appearance-based gaze estimation due to it’s high accuracy. In machine learning, a set of algorithms is used to learn patterns from data. This data can be anything like images, videos, text, etc. After the machine learns these patterns, it can then predict future data. This process is known as supervised learning because the machine is being given inputs (i.e., data) along with the corresponding outputs (i.e., labels). For example, if we were teaching a machine to identify objects in images, we would give it a dataset of images that have been labeled with the object in each image. The machine would then learn the patterns that distinguish one object from another. After learning these patterns, the machine would be able to take an input image and predict which object is in that image<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">
               This process can be extended to other types of data like video and text. With enough data, the machine can learn any type of pattern that exists in that data. This is why computer vision technologies are so powerful; they allow us to extract information from images and videos that would otherwise be hidden to us...These techniques have a wide range of applications, including gaze estimation. Gaze estimation is the process of inferring where someone is looking based on their eye movements. This information can be used for a variety of purposes, such as human-computer interaction, driver assistance systems, and security systems. There are many different methods for estimating gaze, but one of the most popular methods is appearance-based gaze estimation. In this method, an algorithm analyzes an image or video of a person’s eyes and infers their gaze direction from their appearance. This method has several advantages over other methods; it does not require special equipment (e.g., eye-tracking glasses), it can work in real-time, and it does not require calibration for each individual user. However, appearance-based gaze estimation is also susceptible to errors due to factors such as lighting conditions, head pose, and blinking. To overcome these errors, many recent studies have used deep neural networks for appearance-based gaze estimation. Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is specially designed for processing complex data like images and videos. By using deep neural networks, researchers have been able to achieve much higher accuracy than previous methods. However, deep neural networks also require large amounts of training data; without enough data, the network will not be able to learn the patterns needed for accurate gaze estimation. Therefore, future work on this topic will focus on collecting more training data so that we can continue to improve the accuracy of appearance-based gaze estimation techniques." Another way to calculate a child's attention span using computer vision and machine learning is to track their facial expressions over a period. If the child consistently displays attentive or engaged expressions, it can be inferred that they have a longer attention span. On the other hand, if the child frequently displays distracted or disinterested facial expressions, it may indicate a shorter attention span. This information can then be used to tailor educational activities for the child and support their learning needs. Therefore, throughout the research, we design and develop a multimodal convolutional neural network based on ensemble techniques to evaluate the attention span of the child, when interacting with the cognitive assessment tasks. This research will significantly impact the learning capacity of students. Throughout this study, we will look at different image processing methods and machine learning algorithms (MLA) that were previously conducted and formulate our own methodology by observing the previously conducted researches for attention span evaluation. 
          <br />The use of multiple parameters in a machine learning model for attention span allows for more accurate and holistic predictions. Having multiple sources of information helps to account for variations in behavior, such as differences in how individuals express their attention through eye gaze or facial expressions. Additionally, using an ensemble model allows for weighting of the various parameters, further improving the model's predictive power. In summary, incorporating multiple parameters into an ensemble model is crucial for accurately measuring a person's attention span. To verify the reliability of the attention span evaluation model that is developed, we have conducted multiple trials with different sets of videos and observers to determine if the model consistently predicts attention levels of the children in line with the ground truth. The model's predictions have also been compared with those of other observers results to see if there is a high level of agreement. Additionally, it can be analyzed any discrepancies between the model's predictions and the ground truth to adjust and improve the model as needed. Overall, conducting multiple trials and comparisons with other observations and the ground truth can help verify the reliability of this attention span evaluation model.

               This process can be extended to other types of data like video and text. With enough data, the machine can learn any type of pattern that exists in that data. This is why computer vision technologies are so powerful; they allow us to extract information from images and videos that would otherwise be hidden to us...These techniques have a wide range of applications, including gaze estimation. Gaze estimation is the process of inferring where someone is looking based on their eye movements. This information can be used for a variety of purposes, such as human-computer interaction, driver assistance systems, and security systems. There are many different methods for estimating gaze, but one of the most popular methods is appearance-based gaze estimation. In this method, an algorithm analyzes an image or video of a person’s eyes and infers their gaze direction from their appearance. This method has several advantages over other methods; it does not require special equipment (e.g., eye-tracking glasses), it can work in real-time, and it does not require calibration for each individual user. However, appearance-based gaze estimation is also susceptible to errors due to factors such as lighting conditions, head pose, and blinking. To overcome these errors, many recent studies have used deep neural networks for appearance-based gaze estimation. Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is specially designed for processing complex data like images and videos. By using deep neural networks, researchers have been able to achieve much higher accuracy than previous methods. However, deep neural networks also require large amounts of training data; without enough data, the network will not be able to learn the patterns needed for accurate gaze estimation. Therefore, future work on this topic will focus on collecting more training data so that we can continue to improve the accuracy of appearance-based gaze estimation techniques." Another way to calculate a child's attention span using computer vision and machine learning is to track their facial expressions over a period. If the child consistently displays attentive or engaged expressions, it can be inferred that they have a longer attention span. On the other hand, if the child frequently displays distracted or disinterested facial expressions, it may indicate a shorter attention span. This information can then be used to tailor educational activities for the child and support their learning needs. Therefore, throughout the research, we design and develop a multimodal convolutional neural network based on ensemble techniques to evaluate the attention span of the child, when interacting with the cognitive assessment tasks. This research will significantly impact the learning capacity of students. Throughout this study, we will look at different image processing methods and machine learning algorithms (MLA) that were previously conducted and formulate our own methodology by observing the previously conducted researches for attention span evaluation. 
          <br />The use of multiple parameters in a machine learning model for attention span allows for more accurate and holistic predictions. Having multiple sources of information helps to account for variations in behavior, such as differences in how individuals express their attention through eye gaze or facial expressions. Additionally, using an ensemble model allows for weighting of the various parameters, further improving the model's predictive power. In summary, incorporating multiple parameters into an ensemble model is crucial for accurately measuring a person's attention span. To verify the reliability of the attention span evaluation model that is developed, we have conducted multiple trials with different sets of videos and observers to determine if the model consistently predicts attention levels of the children in line with the ground truth. The model's predictions have also been compared with those of other observers results to see if there is a high level of agreement. Additionally, it can be analyzed any discrepancies between the model's predictions and the ground truth to adjust and improve the model as needed. Overall, conducting multiple trials and comparisons with other observations and the ground truth can help verify the reliability of this attention span evaluation model.

            Computer vision technologies are widely used in appearance-based gaze tracking techniques to detect the eye gaze. A video from a normal web camera or low-resolution camera is enough, but a large set of training data is required to make sure the accuracy of the estimation models are high. Basic machine learning models were used earlier but nowadays convolutional neural networks and deep neural networks are much more popular in appearance-based gaze estimation due to it’s high accuracy. In machine learning, a set of algorithms is used to learn patterns from data. This data can be anything like images, videos, text, etc. After the machine learns these patterns, it can then predict future data. This process is known as supervised learning because the machine is being given inputs (i.e., data) along with the corresponding outputs (i.e., labels). For example, if we were teaching a machine to identify objects in images, we would give it a dataset of images that have been labeled with the object in each image. The machine would then learn the patterns that distinguish one object from another.
