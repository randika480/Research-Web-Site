          <p class="about_abstract">Automated cognitive assessment tools are state of the art in assessing human cognition development. Due to the low availability of the datasets and the complexity of collecting data to assess cognitive ability of primary grade sinhala children in Sri Lanka, this study focuses on developing machine learning models using a low quantity of data and develop models to assess Reasoning IQ, Knowledge IQ, Mental Chronometry and Attention-level evaluation. Our solution includes a speech recognition system to evaluate child’s verbal responses and vocabulary responses in Sinhala language, a Sinhala handwritten letter recognition model, hand drawn shape recognition model, gaze estimation, blink count detection and facial expression recognition model to evaluate the above four aspects of cognitive development of a child. For the speech recognition model, we have achieved a Word error rate (WER) of 40.1%and a validation accuracy of 97.14%.  For the Sinhala handwritten character recognition model, we have achieved a 97% validation accuracy. Also, we have achieved an 89% validation accuracy for the hand-drawn shape recognition model and an 85% accuracy for the combination of gaze estimation, blink count detection and facial expression recognition model</p>

                <strong>Intelligence is the metric that expresses variations in cognition across individuals [1] and refers to a person's ability to reason, solve problems, and learn. The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is used to measure an individual's intelligence derived from the results of specifically conducted tests. Initially, intelligence has been viewed as a fixed amount of cognitive capability that individuals are born with and cannot be increased [2]. However, later studies have found that different age groups have different IQ levels due to the cognitive development that begins during pregnancy and lasts until late adolescence [1]. 
                  IQ scores can help parents to establish realistic expectations based on their child's capabilities. The evidence, including a major meta-analysis of 65 studies, shows that IQ positively relates to educational and occupational achievements [3]. According to [4], Verbal Intelligence is a better predictor of academic success than other measurements. IQ scores also can be used to identify learning disabilities in children. 
                  More than a century of evidence has been amassed worldwide on cognitive ability assessments and the evaluation of correlates. This evidence has been used to advance society's progress, particularly population health. Additionally, it is generally acknowledged that these factors strongly depend on each individual's culture and environment [1]. Many intelligent scales and tools have been built to identify psychological conditions where some tests might specifically target a condition while others might be catered toward a general screening. 
                  The measuring Scale of Intelligence is the first validated cognitive measurement tool which was developed by psychologist Alfred Binet and psychiatrist Theodore Simon in 1905 at the request of the French government to identify students who would face the difficulties in schoolwork. The scale was composed of 30 rapid cognitive tests arranged in descending order of difficulty. The Binet-Simon Scale can be identified as the basis for modern IQ testing [5]. Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale is the standardized version of Binet's original test using a sample of American participants [6]. Another most prominent scale is the Wechsler intelligence scale which was published in 1939. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children can be used for children between the ages of 6 and 16 [7]. While the scales described below are not automated or digitalized, they are still used to measure cognitive abilities because of their credibility. 
                  Several automated tools are used globally to measure cognitive abilities. CogniFit General Cognitive Assessment tool measures general cognition in children above the age of 7 and adults. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is a language-independent, culturally neutral, non-invasive, and requires no technical knowledge or familiarity with computers, making them suitable for large, multi-site studies and diverse participant groups. The CANTAB batteries have been extensively used to assess cognitive performances in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Dementia, Korsakoff Syndrome, and Basal Ganglia disorders [7]  </strong>

                <strong>Evidence on cognitive ability assessments and evaluation of its correlates have been accumulated over the past few years. They have been used in the advancements of the society, particularly in the health domain. Many intelligent scales and tools have been built to identify psychological conditions where some tests might specifically target a condition while others might be catered toward a general screening. The need for a systematically validated and automated cognitive assessment tool for children has been on the rise in the Sri Lankan Health Sector. Although globally prevalent and pioneers in intelligence scales such as Weschler and Stanford Binet exist, they have failed to address an important issue. The assessments are not culturally, linguistically or country-specific, even though attempts have been made to diversify tests to enable the localization of the functions of different processes in cognition. According to[1],  the International Classification of Diseases-10th revision identifies ten categories pertaining to specific disorders of psychological development. It states that it is mandatory to have a validated cognitive assessment to diagnose these deficiencies in children. Cognitive assessment tools such as Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and Stanford-Binet lack insight and evidence against the correlation of child cognitive capabilities in the Sri Lankan context. Moreover, these assessment tools have specific criteria to be met to gain authority for their usage, and significant commercial expenditure must be allocated for continuous usage. The growing number of child referrals into psychiatry units in Child hospitals in Sri Lanka has not helped the situation alone. This concludes that automated cognitive tools will be future-proof and add more value when evaluating cognitive abilities of children. </strong>

                <strong>Cognitive tests can reveal a child's degree of skill and what he or she is capable of. The research, which includes a large meta-analysis of 65 studies, suggests that cognition is linked to educational and vocational success. Learning difficulties can also be detected using cognitive assessment tests. To do so, you'll need to figure out if these kids are performing below expectations based on their standard. Those who do not meet the required standards may be suffering from one or more learning difficulties. Some of the most popular measures used by professionals while performing evaluations are the Wechsler series, the Woodcock-Johnson, and the Stanford-Binet. All of these empirically validated intelligence assessment measures are based on a range of variables used by test developers to evaluate intelligence, including verbal intelligence, visual and verbal memory, reasoning skills, processing speed, and other factors. 
                  All of the aforementioned measurements have been normed over a range of age groups, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses, and the test is chosen depending on the individual's specific qualities. And the approach for evaluating children's abilities must be one that all children are familiar with.Sri Lanka does not undertake a complete cognitive examination of children in the health sector using a fully automated cognitive assessment tool suited for the Sri Lankan context. The lack of a culturally relevant tool that can be utilized in the local languages is one reason for this. The second problem is the high commercial costs associated with globally recognized cognitive evaluation products.

                The study used a combination of a publicly available Sinhala adult speech dataset from Open Speech and Language Resources (OpenSLR) [8] and a Sinhala child speech data corpus that was created by manually collecting data from school children (Table 1). This contained 178,096 utterances and 50,785 unique words on the adult speech dataset and 164 utterances and additional 78 unique words from the child speech dataset.  The child speech audio data was collected using the Praat tool [9] in 44100 Hz sampling frequency under mono channel audio. Lexicon preparation that maps phoneme representation with relevant word for every unique word in the dataset was prepared using “Subasa Transliterator” tool [10]. 

In the data pre-processing stage, all speakers were tagged with a gender-representing letter (‘F’ or ‘M’) by listening to recordings under that speaker. Further, in order to process data by the ASR system, every punctuation mark and irrelevant characters were replaced with white spaces and English characters were removed. All the numerical values have been replaced with textual representations, and non-printable characters have been removed while correcting all the spelling mistakes.  

The child data collection was conducted on a less noise environment with Sinhala speaking school children aged between seven and nine years old. Each child provided audio recordings of a unique word list by utterance of each word separately and complete sentences combining variety of Sinhala words with proper grammar. Each word on their recordings was verified and validated by doctors to make sure they are within the common usage of selected children’s vocabulary in regard to their age.
